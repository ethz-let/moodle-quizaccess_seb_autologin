# SEB Auto-Login Access rule.

* This accessrule plugin (/mod/quiz/accessrule/seb_autologin) allows users to auto login to moodle when launching a quiz that is using SEB accessrule (with upload client config, or manually created config options).

* The plugin also offers access to current logged in user info. This info is used by SEB Client.

# Required moodle version: 4.2+

# Disclaimer:
Every effort has been put into this plugin to work around SEB core plugin limited access scope and strucutre, hence, and due to the limited felxibility in SEB plugin code, the plugin is not written in the most efficient way. Please keep in your mind that the plugin might have an impact or a negative effect on your setup.
